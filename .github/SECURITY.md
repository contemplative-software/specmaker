# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Supported versions

We generally support the most recent release series. During pre‑1.0, please use the latest published version or `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, choose one of the following:

1. Open a private security advisory in GitHub (recommended):
   - Go to the repository “Security” tab → “Advisories” → “Report a vulnerability”.
2. Email the maintainer: <darec.specmaker@gmail.com>

Please include as much detail as possible to reproduce the issue and an assessment of impact.

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.

## Safe harbor

We will not pursue legal action against good‑faith security research that abides by responsible disclosure.
